# Svanity: Ethereum and Solana Vanity Wallet Generator

Welcome to the **Svanity Wallet Generator**! This program runs locally on your console, allowing you to generate a Solana address with a desired prefix. It estimates the time required to reach 50% probability of finding the address and saves the keys to a JSON file.

## Features

- **Custom Prefix**: Generate Solana wallets with your desired prefix.
- **Time Estimation**: Get an estimate of the time needed to find your vanity address based on your machine.
- **Key Storage**: Save your generated keys securely in a JSON file.

## Requirements

- Node.js

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ciceroleitea/svanity.git
    cd svanity-wallet-generator
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the generator script using node:**

    ```sh
    node svanity
    ```

### Steps

1. **Enter your desired prefix**

    When prompted, input the prefix you want for your ETH or SOL address. The program will start generating addresses until it finds one with the specified prefix.

2. **Estimated Time**

    The program will provide an estimated time to find the address with your desired prefix based on its complexity and your current machines speed.

3. **Key Storage**

    Once a matching address is found, the program will save the public and private keys securely into a JSON file named `solana_vanity_keys.json` (Example).

## Example

- Here's a quick run-through of how the program works:

    ```sh
    $ node svanity
    Enter your desired address prefix: DEV
    This device will generate ~2150.00 Addresses Per Second (APS)
    Estimated time until 50% probability: 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 45 seconds
    Logs will be sent every 100,000 addresses generated
    Do you want to proceed? (y/n): Y
    LFGGGG
    Time until 50% probability of success: 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 20 seconds
    Count: 100000
    APS: 2213.22
    50% probability reached!
    Count: 200000
    APS: 2110.7
    Generated Address: DEV1...
    Secret Key: 2ByB...
    Keys saved to solana_vanity_keys.json
    ```
